## 🚀 How to Use

### First-Time Setup

1. **Create Super Admin**:
   ```bash
   # Download service account key from Firebase Console
   # Save as scripts/serviceAccountKey.json
   node scripts/set-super-admin.js
   ```

2. **Login**:
   - Go to `http://localhost:5173/admin/login`
   - Enter super admin credentials
   - Redirected to `/admin/dashboard`

3. **Create Shops & Admins**:
   - Use Super Admin Dashboard
   - Shops tab: Create and manage shops
   - Admins tab: Create admins and assign shops

### Login Flow

```
User enters credentials at /admin/login
          ↓
Firebase Authentication validates
          ↓
AuthContext checks role:
  ├─ Super Admin (custom claim) → /admin/dashboard
  └─ Admin (Firestore doc) → /admin/my-shops
```

### Access Matrix

| Route | Super Admin | Admin | Public |
|-------|------------|-------|--------|
| `/admin/login` | ✅ | ✅ | ✅ |
| `/admin/dashboard` | ✅ | ❌ | ❌ |
| `/admin/my-shops` | ❌ | ✅ | ❌ |
| `/onboarding` | ✅ | ❌ | ❌ |
| `/dashboard` | ✅ | ✅* | ❌ |
| `/shop/:shopId` | ✅ | ✅ | ✅ |

*Only for assigned shops

## 📊 Firestore Structure

### Super Admin (Custom Claims)
```json
{
  "customClaims": {
    "superAdmin": true
  }
}
```
*Set via Firebase Admin SDK*

### Regular Admin (Firestore)
```
admins/{uid}
  ├─ email: "admin@example.com"
  ├─ assignedShops: ["shop1", "shop2"]
  ├─ createdAt: "2025-10-04..."
  └─ createdBy: "superAdminUID"
```

## 🔐 Security Features

1. **Route Protection**: All admin routes check authentication & role
2. **Shop-Level Access**: Admins can only manage assigned shops
3. **Custom Claims**: Super admin status verified via Firebase tokens
4. **Firestore Validation**: Admin role checked against Firestore documents
5. **Auto-Redirect**: Unauthenticated users sent to login
6. **Role-Based UI**: Navbar and features adapt to user role

## 🎨 UI Highlights

### Super Admin Dashboard
- **Stats Cards**: Total shops, active/inactive shops, total admins
- **Tabs**: 
  - Shops: Create, view, activate/deactivate, delete
  - Admins: Create, assign shops, view, delete
- **Modals**: 
  - Delete shop confirmation
  - Create admin form with multi-select shop assignment

### Admin My Shops Page
- **Shop Cards**: Visual cards for each assigned shop
- **Quick Actions**:
  - Manage Shop (→ Dashboard)
  - View Storefront (→ Public shop page)
- **Empty State**: Message when no shops assigned

### Navigation Bar
- **Dynamic Branding**: Shows role-based title
- **Role-Based Links**: Different nav items for each role
