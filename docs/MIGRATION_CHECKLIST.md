## üöÄ Deployment Steps

### 1. Local Testing

```bash
# Start development server
npm run dev

# Test these URLs:
http://localhost:5173/onboarding
http://localhost:5173/dashboard
http://localhost:5173/shop/test-shop
http://localhost:5173/shop/test-shop/customize/cake-id
http://localhost:5173/shop/test-shop/cart
http://localhost:5173/shop/test-shop/checkout
http://localhost:5173/shop/test-shop/track/order-id
```

### 2. Build for Production

```bash
# Create production build
npm run build

# Preview production build
npm run preview
```

### 3. Firebase/Firestore Setup

- [ ] Ensure Firestore rules allow:
  - Public read for `cakeShops/{shopId}`
  - Public read/write for `cakeShops/{shopId}/orders`
  - Public read for `cakeShops/{shopId}/cakes`
  - Public read for `cakeShops/{shopId}/options`

Example Firestore rules:
```javascript
rules_version = '2';
service cloud.firestore {
  match /databases/{database}/documents {
    match /cakeShops/{shopId} {
      allow read: if true;
      allow write: if request.auth != null;
      
      match /cakes/{cakeId} {
        allow read: if true;
        allow write: if request.auth != null;
      }
      
      match /options/{optionId} {
        allow read: if true;
        allow write: if request.auth != null;
      }
      
      match /orders/{orderId} {
        allow read: if true;
        allow create: if true;
        allow update: if request.auth != null;
        allow delete: if request.auth != null;
      }
    }
  }
}
```

### 4. Firebase Storage Rules

```javascript
rules_version = '2';
service firebase.storage {
  match /b/{bucket}/o {
    match /shops/{shopId}/{allPaths=**} {
      allow read: if true;
      allow write: if request.auth != null;
    }
  }
}
```

### 5. Deploy to Hosting

Choose your platform:

#### Vercel
```bash
# Install Vercel CLI
npm i -g vercel

# Deploy
vercel

# Production deployment
vercel --prod
```

#### Netlify
```bash
# Install Netlify CLI
npm i -g netlify-cli

# Deploy
netlify deploy

# Production deployment
netlify deploy --prod
```

#### Firebase Hosting
```bash
# Install Firebase CLI
npm i -g firebase-tools

# Login
firebase login

# Initialize (if not done)
firebase init hosting

# Deploy
firebase deploy --only hosting
```

## üîó Update External Links

If you have existing links pointing to shops:

### Old Format
```
https://yourdomain.com/cakeshopa
```

### New Format
```
https://yourdomain.com/shop/cakeshopa
```

### Update Locations
- [ ] Social media profiles
- [ ] Email signatures
- [ ] Marketing materials
- [ ] QR codes
- [ ] Business cards
- [ ] Third-party listings

## üìä Analytics Updates

If using Google Analytics or similar:

- [ ] Update page tracking for new URLs
- [ ] Set up events for:
  - Shop creation (onboarding)
  - Cake customization
  - Cart additions
  - Checkout completions
  - Order tracking views

## üîÑ Backward Compatibility

### Redirects (Optional)

If you want to support old URLs, add redirects:

**Vercel** - `vercel.json`:
```json
{
  "redirects": [
    {
      "source": "/:shopId/customize/:cakeId",
      "destination": "/shop/:shopId/customize/:cakeId",
      "permanent": true
    },
    {
      "source": "/:shopId/cart",
      "destination": "/shop/:shopId/cart",
      "permanent": true
    }
  ]
}
```

**Netlify** - `_redirects` file:
```
/:shopId/customize/:cakeId  /shop/:shopId/customize/:cakeId  301
/:shopId/cart               /shop/:shopId/cart               301
/:shopId/checkout           /shop/:shopId/checkout           301
```

## üêõ Common Issues & Solutions

### Issue: Shop not found

- Verify router configuration
- Test in incognito mode

### Issue: Cart not persisting
**Solution**:
- Check localStorage is enabled
