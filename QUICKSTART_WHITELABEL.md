# üöÄ Quick Start Guide - White-Label Cake Shop

## What Changed?

Your cake shop platform is now a **white-label system**. Instead of showing all shops on one website, each shop gets its own branded storefront.

### Examples

- **Shop A**: `cakeshopa.vercel.app` ‚Üí Shows only Shop A's cakes
- **Shop B**: `sweetcakes.com` ‚Üí Shows only Shop B's cakes
- **Shop C**: `customcakes.vercel.app` ‚Üí Shows only Shop C's cakes

## üèÉ Running the Project

### Development Mode (Test Multiple Shops)

```bash
# Install dependencies
npm install

# Start dev server
npm run dev

# Access different shops
http://localhost:5174/shop1     # Shop 1
http://localhost:5174/shop2     # Shop 2
http://localhost:5174/myshop    # Any shop ID
```

### How It Works (Development)

- The first path segment (`/shop1`) identifies which shop to load
- Data is fetched from `cakeShops/shop1` in Firestore
- Each shop is completely isolated

---

## üåê Production Deployment

### Deploy for a Single Shop

```bash
# 1. Create .env.production
echo "VITE_SHOP_ID=cakeshopa" > .env.production

# 2. Build the project
npm run build

# 3. Deploy to Vercel
vercel --prod

# 4. Configure subdomain
# Vercel Dashboard ‚Üí Settings ‚Üí Domains
# Add: cakeshopa.vercel.app
```

### How It Works (Production)

- Shop ID is extracted from subdomain (`cakeshopa.vercel.app` ‚Üí `shopId = "cakeshopa"`)
- Fallback to `VITE_SHOP_ID` environment variable
- Data fetched from `cakeShops/cakeshopa` in Firestore

## üìù Setting Up a New Shop

### 1. Add Shop to Firestore

In Firebase Console ‚Üí Firestore Database:

```javascript
Collection: cakeShops
Document ID: mynewshop

Fields:
{
  name: "My Awesome Cakes",
  description: "Delicious custom cakes for every occasion",
  logo: "https://yourimageurl.com/logo.png",          // Optional
  coverImage: "https://yourimageurl.com/cover.jpg",   // Optional
  branding: {
    colors: {
      primary: "#ff69b4",      // Pink
      secondary: "#9b59b6"     // Purple
    }
  }
}
```

### 2. Add Cakes

```javascript
Collection: cakeShops/mynewshop/cakes
Document ID: cake1

Fields:
{
  name: "Chocolate Delight",
  description: "Rich chocolate cake with ganache",
  basePrice: 500,
  image: "https://yourimageurl.com/cake.jpg"
}
```

### 3. Add Customization Options

```javascript
Collection: cakeShops/mynewshop/options
Document ID: customizer

Fields:
{
  bases: ["Chocolate", "Vanilla", "Red Velvet"],
  sizes: {
    "Small (6-inch)": 500,
    "Medium (8-inch)": 800,
    "Large (10-inch)": 1200
  },
  toppings: [
    {
      name: "Strawberries",
      emoji: "üçì",
      price: 50
    },
    {
      name: "Chocolate Chips",
      emoji: "üç´",
      price: 30
    }
  ]
}
```

### 4. Deploy

```bash
# Set shop ID
VITE_SHOP_ID=mynewshop vercel --prod --name mynewshop

# Result: mynewshop.vercel.app
```

### 5. Access

## üé® Customizing Shop Branding

### Logo & Cover Image

Upload images to Firebase Storage or use any image URL:

```javascript
// In Firestore: cakeShops/myshop
{
  logo: "https://firebasestorage.googleapis.com/.../logo.png",
  coverImage: "https://firebasestorage.googleapis.com/.../cover.jpg"
}
```

### Colors

Update the branding colors:

```javascript
// In Firestore: cakeShops/myshop
{
  branding: {
    colors: {
      primary: "#e91e63",    // Your primary color (hex)
      secondary: "#673ab7"   // Your secondary color (hex)
    }
  }
}
```

The app will automatically apply these colors to:

- Background gradients
- Headers and titles
- Buttons and accents

// Check in browser console
import { getShopId } from "./src/utils/shopUtils.js";
console.log(getShopId()); // Should show correct shop ID
```

**Solution**:

1. Upload images to Firebase Storage

## üí° Tips

### Multiple Shops from One Codebase

You can deploy the same codebase multiple times with different `VITE_SHOP_ID` values:

```bash
# Shop A
VITE_SHOP_ID=shopa vercel --prod --name shopa

# Shop B
VITE_SHOP_ID=shopb vercel --prod --name shopb

# Shop C
VITE_SHOP_ID=shopc vercel --prod --name shopc
```

### Local Testing

Test multiple shops without deploying:

```bash
npm run dev

# Then visit:
http://localhost:5174/shop1
http://localhost:5174/shop2
http://localhost:5174/shop3
```

### Environment Variables

Create `.env.local` to set default shop for development:

```env
VITE_SHOP_ID=myshop
```

Then you can access directly: `http://localhost:5174/`
